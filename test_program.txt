# Program Flow Explanation:
# ------------------------
# Memory Locations:
# 100: First input number
# 101: Second input number
# 102: Result of addition
# 103: Result of division
# 104: Result of multiplication
# 110: Branch target for negative check
# 115: Branch target for program end

# Step-by-Step Execution:
# 1. READ first number into memory location 100
# 2. READ second number into memory location 101
# 3. LOAD first number from memory 100 into accumulator
# 4. ADD second number from memory 101 to accumulator
# 5. STORE result in memory location 102
# 6. LOAD addition result from memory 102 into accumulator
# 7. DIVIDE by second number from memory 101
# 8. STORE division result in memory location 103
# 9. LOAD division result from memory 103 into accumulator
# 10. MULTIPLY by second number from memory 101
# 11. STORE multiplication result in memory location 104
# 12. LOAD multiplication result from memory 104 into accumulator
# 13. BRANCHNEG to memory 110 if result is negative
# 14. LOAD addition result from memory 102 into accumulator
# 15. WRITE addition result to screen
# 16. BRANCH to memory 115
# 17. LOAD division result from memory 103 into accumulator
# 18. WRITE division result to screen
# 19. BRANCH to memory 115
# 20. LOAD multiplication result from memory 104 into accumulator
# 21. WRITE multiplication result to screen
# 22. HALT program
